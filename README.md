## üîç View Source Code

All the source code are under `src` directory.

It's recommended to view them at local with these steps:

1. Make sure you've installed Git, Node.js and Visual Studio Code.
2. Clone this repository with Git.
3. Run `npm i` or `yarn` to install TypeScript.
4. Open this repository in Visual Studio Code.
5. Enjoy it!

## üìù Contributing

Create a new empty directory under `src` directory
and give it a descriptive and short name,
then put your source code in it.

Don't forget to put a `tsconfig.json` file into your directory,
and let it extend from the `tsconfig.json` file of root directory.
Then, update the `files` field of `tsconfig.json`.

Optionally, you can put a readme in that directory to introduce
your code in detail.

Last, please update the "Overview List" section of this readme
to add a new item for your code with brief.
